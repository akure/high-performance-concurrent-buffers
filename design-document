This is the design document for the high performance concurrent buffer project.

In this project I am planning to implement buffers based on different data structures which can server as concurrent buffers 
for multi-threaded system design. 

The programming language that we concentrate is C++0x ( C++11 ) 

We would also compare the performace of different buffers in different scenarios, initially we would consider the 
situation where the server is receiving a very high load of input data lets sat 15,000 msg per sec continously for
n ( say 8 hours a day in fix time) Well the input rate pattern can vary between 10,000 msg per sec to 15,000 msg per sec.
We have to design a concurrent buffer that can be used in such a situation, It should be scalable and enough flexible for 
multiple threads. It should be able to support multi producer multi consumer patterns for high processing.

There should be no cumulative data accumulation in the buffers for a long time performance. 
Data should be consumable from the buffers.
Also there should be no loss in the input data which are coming from the network. 

List of concurrent buffers:
1. concurrent dequeue 

2. concurrent vector

3. concurrent map

4. concurrent  linked list

5. concurrent nested buffers
    we will develop this concept as we go ahead with basic concurrent buffers.
